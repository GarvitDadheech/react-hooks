// In this assignment, you will create a component that renders a large list of sentences and includes an input field for filtering these items. 
// The goal is to use useMemo to optimize the filtering process, ensuring the list is only re-calculated when necessary (e.g., when the filter criteria changes).
// You will learn something new here, specifically how you have to pass more than one value in the dependency array
